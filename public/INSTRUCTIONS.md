# How to Add Your Images

You have 5 beautiful images ready to use! Here's exactly where to put them:

## 📂 File Placement

### Hero Image (Main Landing Page)
- **File name**: `hero.jpg`
- **Location**: `/public/hero.jpg`
- **Which image**: The portrait with gold side lighting (first image)

### Gallery Images (Lash Styles)
All go in `/public/lashes/` folder:

1. **classic.jpg** - The close-up with eye closed, side view (second image)
2. **hybrid.jpg** - Volume lashes with gold accents, eye open (fifth image)
3. **russian.jpg** - Dramatic volume lashes (third image)
4. **mega.jpg** - Could use third or fourth image (most dramatic one)
5. **wet.jpg** - Gold lighting with dramatic volume (fourth image)

## 🖥️ Two Ways to Add Images

### Option 1: Using Your Computer (Easiest)

1. Download all 5 images from the chat
2. Rename them as listed above
3. Open your project folder: `lashes-by-brooke`
4. Put `hero.jpg` directly in the `public` folder
5. Put the other 4 in the `public/lashes` folder

### Option 2: Using GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to `public` folder
3. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
4. Upload `hero.jpg` here
5. Navigate to `public/lashes` folder
6. Upload the 4 lash style images there

## ✅ After Adding

1. Commit the changes if using GitHub
2. The app will automatically display your images!
3. If running locally, refresh your browser to see them

## 📝 Image Mapping

Based on what I see in your images:

- **Hero**: Beautiful portrait with dramatic gold lighting ✨
- **Classic**: Natural, individual lashes (eye closed view)
- **Hybrid**: Mix of volume and detail (eye open with gold)
- **Russian Volume**: Full, dramatic lashes
- **Mega Volume**: Maximum drama (can reuse one if needed)
- **Wet Look**: Textured with gold lighting

Note: You have 5 images but need 6 total (1 hero + 5 styles). You can either:
- Use one image for both Russian and Mega (they're similar)
- Generate one more image with Gemini
- We can adjust the app to show only 4 styles instead of 5

Let me know once you've added them and we can test!
